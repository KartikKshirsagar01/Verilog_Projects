# Sequential Circuits

This directory hosts Verilog projects for sequential digital logic circuits, including various flip-flops, latches, counters, shift registers, and FIFO modules.

## Key Modules Include

- Clock, D-Latch and D-Flip Flop designs with asynchronous and synchronous reset/set options.
- Up Counters, Modulus Counters, Range Counters, and Loadable Counters
- Shift Registers (Universal and directional shift registers)
- Single Clock and Dual Clock FIFO designs
