# Verilog_Projects

This repository contains Verilog HDL design files of various digital circuits organized into three main categories: Combinational Circuits, Sequential Circuits, and Memories. Each project includes design files in various coding styles (structural, behavioral, and dataflow) along with corresponding testbenches for verification.

### Sequential Circuits
This folder hosts various sequential circuit designs including flip-flops, latches, counters, and shift registers.

Key examples:
- Clock, D-Latch and D-Flip Flop modules with asynchronous/synchronous resets and set options.
- Various counters: Up Counter, Up/Down Counter, Modulus Counter, Range Counters
- Shift Registers and Universal Shift Registers
- FIFO designs: Single Clock FIFO, Dual Clock FIFO

Each design includes behavioral and dataflow models where applicable, along with testbenches.

### Memories
Contains designs of different RAM modules:
- Single Port RAM (versions 1 to 4)
- Dual Port RAM (versions 1 and 2)
- True Dual Port RAM (versions 1 and 2)

Each memory design includes associated testbenches.
